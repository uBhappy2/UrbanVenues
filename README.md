# UrbanVenues

Foursquare Challenge:

Using the Foursquare API please build an app that checks for the user's current location and finds venues nearby and displays venue details as needed. The app should include the following:
	•	Networking code. Your app should NOT use one of the available Foursquare sdk's so either raw NSURLSessions/Requests or something like AFNetworking
	•	Geolocation of user
	⁃	should also handle when geolocation is off or not enabled yet
	⁃	A way to select geolocation as an option (a button maybe)
	•	Search by query
	⁃	should allow users to search based on a query rather than their current location
	•	A list of results from foursquare with all the information you believe a user needs to see
	⁃	An icon & distance would be nice
	•	A detail view for a venue with extended details that you think are important (like venue photo, etc)

For extra credit you could:
	•	Add in some nice transitions to and from list views to details
	•	Add your own personal UI flare
	•	Make the list view infinitely scrollable (pagination)
